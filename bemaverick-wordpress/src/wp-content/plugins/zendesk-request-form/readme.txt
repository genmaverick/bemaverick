== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What about privacy and GDPR? =

This plugin does not store any data submitted via the form. Your site connects directly to the Zendesk API to transmit the ticket data immediately. For information about privacy and GDPR, please see Zendesk's policy on [this page](https://www.zendesk.co.uk/company/customers-partners/eu-data-protection/).

= How do I get my Zendesk API key? =

You can generate an API key from your Zendesk dashboard using [this guide](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/226022787-Generating-a-new-API-token-).

= How are messages sent to Zendesk? =

This plugin will connect directly to your Zendesk account via the Zendesk API. This means you do not need to worry about missed emails being sent. The data is transferred directly via the WordPress HTTP API.

= Can I translate the form into my language? =

This plugin is fully translatable into any language. If you find that there is some text that has not already been translated, you can add your language on [this page](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/zendesk-request-form/dev).

= How do I change the order of the form fields? =

You can set the position of each field using the [Order value](http://i.imgur.com/oyZ5BE4.png) whilst editing the custom field. Lower numbers appear first in the form.

You can also use a plugin such as [this](https://wordpress.org/plugins/intuitive-custom-post-order/) to re-order the fields. This is much easier since it allows you to drag and drop them into the correct order.

= Is this plugin free? =

Yep! This plugin was created for our own suppport site, so we will continue to add new features. If you have a suggestion, you are welcome to post it in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/zendesk-request-form).
